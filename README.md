# double_precesion_floating_multiplier
This is my project on double precesion floating point multiplier.
codes are written in verilog and tested in basys 3 artix 7 fpga board.
reference paper link is below one can go through the paper for deep understanding of codes and about floating point multipliers.
there is slight variations on this project from paper which are as follows:
In place of dsp direct verilog codes of multipliers were used, so that asic flow of project can also be done.(asic flow in cadence)
hence results may slighly varry from paper because of this variation and due to the fact that diffrent board(vertex7) were used by the author but simillar trend can be seen in
all over funtionality and approach towads obtaining fast and efficinet double precesion multiplier.
